            The ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology (VRST) is the premier
            international symposium for the presentation of new research results, systems and
            techniques among researchers and developers concerned with augmented, virtual and mixed
            reality (AR/VR/MR) software and technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            The VRST brings together the main international research groups working on AR/VR/MR,
            along with many of the world&rsquo;s leading companies that provide or consume AR/VR
            systems. The VRST 2019 conference will be held in Sydney, Australia, hosted by Western
            Sydney University, from Tuesday, November 12 to Friday, November 15, 2019. The event is
            sponsored by ACM SIGCHI and SIGGRAPH.

          <strong> Paper Format </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Paper submissions should be anonymous and prepared in the "<strong>ACM Standard</strong> "
          format, also known as the "<strong>SigConf</strong> " format. Word and LaTeX templates for
          the "ACM Standard" / "SigConf" format can be found in the official 2017 ACM Master article
          template packages:{' '}
          <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">
            www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template
          </a>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong> Maximum length </strong>
        </p>
        <p>Full research paper submission: 9 pages + references</p>
        <p>Short paper submission: 4 pages + references</p>
        <p>Poster submission: 2 pages including references</p>
        <p>Industrial paper submission: 8 pages including references</p>
        <p>2-column "teaser" figures on the front page are allowed for all kinds of submissions.</p>
        <p>
          <strong> Anonymity Guidelines </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Please remove author and institution information from the author list on the title page,
          remove author information from all paper headers, and remove from the text any clues that
          would directly identify any of the authors. Please anonymize your PDF file. Note that PDF
          creator programs may automatically include author information in the file metadata.
        </p>
        <p>
          Citations of your own published work (including online) must be in the third person, in a
          manner that is not traceable to the identity of the authors. For example, the wording "in
          [3], Mountain and River have proposed..." is acceptable, whereas "in [3], we have
          proposed..." is not. (Where reference [3] is listed explicitly as "Mountain, A. and River,
          A., Detecting Mountains and Rivers, In <em>Proc. UIST '16</em> , 721-741.")
        </p>
        <p>
          Failure to comply with the above requirements will result in an automatic rejection of the
          paper.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong> Supplementary Materials </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Submissions may be (optionally) accompanied by additional materials such as images,
          videos, or electronic documents. These materials do not form a part of the official
          submission. They will be viewed only at the discretion of the reviewers. All content
          should be in a portable format that is unlikely to require the user to download additional
          programs. For example, you may prefer PDF or HTML for documents, PNG or JPEG for images,
          and QuickTime or MPEG for videos. The total file size for supplementary materials should
          not exceed a total of 50MB.
        </p>
        <p>
          To the extent possible, accepted papers should stand on their own, with the additional
          material providing supplementary information or confirmation of results. It is, however,
          appropriate to refer to video footage in the paper.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong> Attendance </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Paper acceptance is always conditional on at least one author registering for the
          conference and presenting their work in person.
